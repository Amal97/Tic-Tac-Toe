# Tic-Tac-Toe

Quick, Simple and Naive implementation of Tic Tac Toe

 Assumptions made:
 		- Player will not input negative numbers
		- The input format will be x,y (that is there is no spaces)
			- where x and y are less than 10 (this is because of how the x and y are read)

 Since its a simple 3x3 board:
		- all the functions are done in 1 class
		- the win and draw cases are hard coded

How to build and run the game:  
  1) cd src
  2) javac Game.java
  3) java Game
